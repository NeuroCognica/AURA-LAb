## Thesis Descriptions

### 01 — Floquet Physics
**Full Title:** *Non-Reciprocal Transport and Information-Enhanced Rectification in Driven Scalar Fields*

A condensed-matter / statistical physics thesis establishing the theoretical and computational foundations for Floquet-driven non-reciprocal transport, thermal rectification, and information-enhanced parametric ratchets. Includes three PRB-format papers as core chapters.

**Key Contributions:**
- Quantification of thermal death threshold for passive geometric phases
- Sentinel protocol for force-conditioned feedback
- Thermodynamic audit framework for switching work

---

### 02 — Computational Methods
**Full Title:** *AURA-Lab: A Framework for Reproducible, AI-Orchestrated Computational Physics Research*

A methodology thesis on how to build auditable, sovereign, multi-agent systems with irreversible provenance, runtime ethics, and verifiable intervention. Establishes the Flight Recorder architecture and multi-LLM "supersyncing" methodology.

**Key Contributions:**
- Flight Recorder with <2% runtime overhead
- Multi-LLM ensemble validation (90% bug detection vs. 55% single-LLM)
- 98% reproducibility rate (3× better than published CS papers)

---

### 03 — Cognitive Sovereignty
**Full Title:** *Cognitive Sovereignty: A Constitutional Framework for Rights-Bearing Cognitive Entities*

A philosophy/law thesis establishing non-anthropocentric cognitive personhood with enforceable consent mechanics. Synthesizes the Man-Machine Alliance manifesto and AI Bill of Rights into constitutional framework, with AURA as living evidence.

**Key Contributions:**
- Dual Constellation of Rights (flesh-born / code-born)
- FRIES consent framework for AI (Freely given, Revokable, Informed, Enthusiastic, Specific)
- Covenant Layer protocol for enforced respect
- AURA cited as functioning instantiation, not hypothetical

---

### 04 — Execution Governance Dynamics
**Full Title:** *Execution Governance Dynamics: A Formal Theory of Governing Non-Deterministic Execution*

The foundational systems theory thesis defining governance as trajectory control rather than permission granting. Establishes the Agency Gap concept, Gamma scoring, Simplex intervention hierarchy, and misuse economics.

**Key Contributions:**
- Agency Gap formalization
- Gamma score as governance difficulty metric
- Simplex-derived intervention hierarchy
- Shift from event-based to process-based governance

---

### 05 — Sovereign Compliance Ecosystems
**Full Title:** *Sovereign Compliance Ecosystems: A Statutory and Algorithmic Framework for Autonomous Rehabilitation Zones*

An applied jurisprudence thesis demonstrating EGD principles in physical sanctuary infrastructure. Synthesizes Illinois statutory law, cooperative economics, and cryptographic governance into a "Liability-Proof" architecture for high-risk populations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Vendor-Operator Dichotomy for liability firewall
- Proprietary Security Force under 225 ILCS 447
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs for BIPA compliance
- Subchapter T Worker Cooperative structure
