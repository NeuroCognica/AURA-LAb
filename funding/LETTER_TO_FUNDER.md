Subject: EGD — Behavioral Governance Framework for Agentic AI (Brief Intro + Request)

---

Hi [NAME/TITLE],

I'm an independent researcher working on **Execution Governance Dynamics (EGD)**, a framework for governing AI agents that generate their own actions at runtime.

The problem: traditional access control checks identity at the gate but doesn't monitor what happens after. Authorized agents can drift into harmful trajectories through sequences of individually reasonable actions.

EGD provides mechanisms for continuous trajectory monitoring, graduated intervention (not binary kill switches), and tamper-evident audit logging. The goal is not to guarantee safety, but to make misuse expensive, detectable, and slow.

I've documented the framework (~15,000 words) and built a reference implementation in Rust (Sentinel, ~3,000 lines, 27 tests passing). What's missing is empirical evaluation and broader review.

**I'm looking for:** a 20-minute call to discuss fit, or consideration for a small research grant ($25k–$75k) to fund 90 days of evaluation work and a public technical report.

**Materials available:**

- Short proposal: [PLACEHOLDER]
- Code repository: [PLACEHOLDER]

Happy to send any of these or answer questions by email.
