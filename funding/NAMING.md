# EGD Canonical Naming

**Purpose:** Consistent terminology across all funding materials.

---

## Canonical Names (USE THESE)

| Concept | Canonical Name | Abbreviation |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| Framework | Execution Governance Dynamics | EGD |
| Reference Implementation | Sentinel Protocol / Sentinel | — |
| Context Binding | Context-Bound Integrity Gate | CBIG |
| Rate Limiting | VDF Rate Shaping | VDF |
| Risk Metric | Gamma Score | Γ |
| Intervention Model | Graduated Intervention / Simplex-style Override | — |
| Audit System | Flight Recorder | — |
| Core Problem | Agency Gap | — |

## Names to AVOID

| Avoid | Reason | Use Instead |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| "Sentinel OS" | Implies operating system; overpromises | "Sentinel Protocol" |
| "AURA Sentinel" | Conflates with physics work | "Sentinel" (standalone) |
| "Gamma Function" | Confuses with mathematical gamma function | "Gamma Score" or "Γ" |
| "Context Cryptography" | Imprecise | "Context-Bound Integrity Gate" |
| "Kill Switch" | EGD explicitly replaces this concept | "Graduated Intervention" |
| "Safety Controller" | Simplex terminology; may confuse | "Fallback / Intervention Controller" |
| "VDF Throttling" | "Throttling" implies policy, not crypto | "VDF Rate Shaping" |
| "Execution Control" | Generic; doesn't convey trajectory awareness | "Execution Governance" |

## Phrase Patterns

**Good:**
- "makes misuse expensive, detectable, and slow"
- "governs trajectories, not just permissions"
- "increases the cost of abuse"
- "continuous trajectory awareness"
- "graduated, proportional response"

**Avoid:**
- "prevents" (use "reduces probability of" or "makes difficult")
- "guarantees" (use "provides assurance" or "increases confidence")
- "secure" as absolute (use "increases security" or "reduces attack surface")
- "solves" (use "addresses" or "mitigates")

## Component Descriptions (One-Liners)

- **CBIG:** Capabilities that only work in the environment where they were issued.
- **VDF Rate Shaping:** Forced delays that cannot be bypassed with more hardware.
- **Gamma Score:** A real-time measure of how hard the agent would be to govern if something went wrong right now.
- **Graduated Intervention:** Responses that scale with risk—from logging to suspension—with the ability to relax when behavior normalizes.
- **Flight Recorder:** Tamper-evident logs that prove what happened.
