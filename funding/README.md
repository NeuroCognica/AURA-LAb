## Sending the Email Today — Checklist

### Preparation
- [ ] Fill in email placeholder in all files
- [ ] Fill in GitHub link (use existing repo or create public one)
- [ ] Create hosted/shareable versions of ONE_PAGER and GRANT_PROPOSAL_SHORT (Google Doc, Notion, or PDF)
- [ ] Review DO_NOT_SAY.md one more time

### For Each Target
- [ ] Research current funding priorities
- [ ] Identify specific contact (name if possible, role if not)
- [ ] Copy LETTER_TO_FUNDER.md template
- [ ] Customize: recipient, angle (from CONTACT_TARGETS.md), specific ask
- [ ] Replace material link placeholders with hosted links
- [ ] Search email for any DO_NOT_SAY violations
- [ ] Send

### Recommended First Targets (Today)
1. **Lightspeed Grants** — Fast decision, code-positive
2. **Long-Term Future Fund** — Public application, quarterly cycle
3. **One consulting outreach** — Use CONSULTING_OFFER.md, target a contact who has deployed AI agents

---

## Consistency Checks

Before any external communication:
1. All terminology matches [NAMING.md](NAMING.md)
2. No phrases from [DO_NOT_SAY.md](DO_NOT_SAY.md)
3. Claims align with [EXTRACTS.md](EXTRACTS.md) limitations
4. Code status described as "skeleton" / "reference implementation" / "not production-hardened"

---

## Source Documents

All materials derived from:
- [EGD Chapters 1-8](../CBIG/) — Framework documentation
- [sentinel_core/](../sentinel_core/) — Reference implementation
- [PROVENANCE.md](../PROVENANCE.md) — Creation timeline

---

## NEEDED FACTS — RESOLVED

**All critical facts have been provided:**

- ✅ Contact email: founder@neurocognica.com
- ✅ GitHub: https://github.com/NeuroCognica/AURA-LAb
- ✅ Entity status: "NeuroCognica Research Initiative" is a working name; not yet incorporated
- ✅ Entity name for formation: "NeuroCognica" (Delaware C-Corp)

**Only remaining placeholders:**

1. `[NAME/TITLE]` — Recipient name in email (customize per send)
2. Hosted links for ONE_PAGER and GRANT_PROPOSAL_SHORT (create shareable versions)

## Additional Document

**[NEUROCOGNICA.md](NEUROCOGNICA.md)** — Full Genesis Funding & Formation Brief

This document has been restructured from a "corporate constitution" into an **emergency funding and formation brief**. It now:

- Opens with the immediate ask (Phase 0 Bootstrap)
- Separates "Now" (bootstrap safeguards) from "Later" (full architecture)
- Includes explicit "Use of Funds: Survival Edition" with dollar amounts
- Lists explicitly deferred activities (what NeuroCognica is NOT doing)
- Ends with Phase V: Immediate Ask ($15k/$25k/$50k tiers)

**Usage:** Lead with ONE_PAGER and GRANT_PROPOSAL_SHORT. Use NEUROCOGNICA.md as detailed backup when funders want to see long-term thinking.
