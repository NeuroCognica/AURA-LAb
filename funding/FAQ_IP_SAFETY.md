# FAQ: Intellectual Property and Sharing

---

### "Do you own my idea if I work with you?"

**No.** 

If you engage us for a consulting audit, your architecture, your systems, and your business remain yours. We provide analysis and recommendations. We do not acquire rights to anything you share with us.

The EGD framework itself is our work. Using EGD concepts in your systems does not create any IP obligation to us.

---

### "Is EGD open source?"

**The framework documentation is publicly available.** The 8-chapter writeup describing EGD theory, mechanisms, limitations, and positioning is intended for open dissemination.

**The Sentinel reference implementation is currently source-available.** The code is published on GitHub for transparency and provenance. Licensing terms for commercial use have not been finalized. We anticipate offering permissive licensing for research and non-commercial use, with commercial licensing available separately.

---

### "What is shared publicly?"

- Framework documentation (concepts, mechanisms, limitations)
- High-level architecture of the Sentinel reference implementation
- Evaluation methodology and metrics
- Technical reports and preprints resulting from funded research

---

### "What isn't shared?"

- Client-specific analysis from consulting engagements (confidential to client)
- Detailed implementation optimizations developed under commercial engagement
- Any materials clients share with us during engagements

---

### "Will you patent this?"

**Current status:** No patents have been filed. 

**Intent:** We may file provisional patents to establish priority dates for specific mechanisms (CBIG, VDF integration patterns, Gamma scoring methods). This is primarily defensive—to prevent others from patenting and restricting the work.

We do not intend to use patents aggressively. If patents are filed, we anticipate offering royalty-free licenses for research and non-commercial use.

**We make no promises about patents.** This is a statement of current intent, not a legal commitment.

---

### "Can I use EGD concepts in my own work?"

**Yes, with appropriate attribution.**

The framework is intended to be useful. If you implement EGD-style mechanisms in your systems, cite the source documentation. If you build on the research, reference it.

For commercial products that incorporate substantial EGD implementation code (not just concepts), contact us to discuss licensing.

---

### "What happens to materials I share during a consulting engagement?"

- Used only for the specific engagement
- Not shared with third parties without your permission
- Deleted within 30 days of engagement completion
- Not used to train models or build competing products

We will sign an NDA if you prefer, but our standard practice is confidential regardless.

---

### "Who owns the output of a consulting engagement?"

**You do.** 

The written report and recommendations are yours to use internally, share with partners, or publish as you see fit. We retain only the right to describe that we have performed "execution governance assessments" as a general capability—without naming clients or revealing specifics.
