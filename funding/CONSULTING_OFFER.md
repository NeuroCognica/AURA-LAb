# EGD Agent Execution Risk Audit
## Consulting Engagement — $2,500 Flat Fee

---

### What This Is

A focused assessment of execution governance risks for your AI agent deployment. Identifies gaps between your current controls and the trajectory-aware governance that agentic systems require.

This is **not** a penetration test, security audit, or compliance review. It is a structured analysis of how your agent execution model handles the "agency gap"—the interval between what you authorize and what your agents actually do.

---

### Deliverables

1. **Architecture Review** — Analysis of your agent deployment model, authorization boundaries, and monitoring infrastructure based on documentation you provide.

2. **Threat Model** — Specific scenarios where authorized agents could drift into harmful trajectories. Focus on compounding actions, velocity risks, and reversibility gaps.

3. **Governance Gap List** — Itemized list of where your current controls address identity/permissions but not behavior/trajectory.

4. **Prioritized Controls** — Recommendations mapped to EGD mechanisms (context binding, rate shaping, trajectory monitoring, graduated intervention, audit logging). Ranked by impact and implementation difficulty.

5. **Written Report** — 5–10 page document covering all of the above, suitable for internal circulation or executive summary.
