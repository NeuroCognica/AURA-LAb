Execution Governance Dynamics (EGD) - Reference Implementation

## Sentinel Core

The `sentinel_core` crate implements the foundational primitives for governing autonomous agents:

- **Context Binding (CBIG)**: Cryptographic binding of capabilities to environmental state
- **Gamma Scoring**: Continuous trajectory risk assessment  
- **Rate Shaping (VDF)**: Temporal constraints on execution velocity
- **Simplex Control**: Graduated intervention hierarchy
- **Flight Recorder**: Tamper-evident audit logging

## Status

This is a skeleton implementation demonstrating architectural feasibility. It proves that the mechanisms described in the EGD thesis are implementable with existing technology.
